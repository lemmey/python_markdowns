The %-chance for the Null-hypothesis to be true.

Usually set at 5% (hence p < .05) or smaller, if a correct rejection is more important (e.g. in medicine where an error might be more costly). 

Contrary to a small chance of observing NO effect, a small p-value assumes a high PROBABILITY of actually having observed an effect, thus accepting the alternative hypothesis (there might be an effect).

Note: If choosing a different than standard significance level (alpha) this usually needs  be justified.

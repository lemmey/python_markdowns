Correlation: Something interesting is going on!
## Linear Regression (LR)

*Finds the line that best fits the data points.*

The best fit line minimizes the sum of squared vertical (y) distances of the data (most commonly).
Null- Hypothesis: The slope of the best fit line is not zero (unequal a static fit like the mean).

LR uses indices of correlation/regression to associate one measurement variable with another, identify the strength of the relationship (r-squared) or extract an equation to predict and model the relationship beyond the measured data (with care and common sense). 

For regression analysis you want to test first: whether there is a significant difference in a dependent variable for a lower-higher predictor variable, if there is a significant correlation between the variables in any direction. 

Second you want to test how tightly the two variables are associated. Thus describing the accuracy with which your predictor can explain the measured dependent variable.

While correlation is (not) assumed for random sample populations. Regression is fitted to a subset/chosen range of data, can however be the same as all the random points acquired during sampling.

Note: For the exact same data, measuring Y over a smaller/decreasing range of X, values yield a smaller r-squared.

### Pearson correlation

R, R-squared

Rho, R, or Pearson) correlation coefficient show the direction of a relationship.

r-squared is also a comparable means, e.g.: R=0.7 and 0.5 => R-Squared 49% and 25%. The first relation ship is twice as strong as the second.

In other terms, R-Squared describes the amount of less variation there is, compared to fitting the data to its mean. Or how close the points are to the line.

## Non-linear regression/Multiple regression

The best fit line minimizes the sum of squared vertical (y) distances of the data.

NULL Hypothesis: The slope of the best fit line is not zero (unequal a static fit like the mean)

Higher polynomials increase the R2, however ...

There is seldom a reason to fit a poylnomial regression line beyond a cubic regression (x3) to explain relations in ecology. For modelling purposes higher level polynomials can be fit tho.

Try rather to transform first and use a lower polynomial level.

For predictions you want a great fit.

## Terminology

**_Repository_** = a location where all the files for a particular project are stored, usually abbreviated to “repo.” Each project will have its own repo, which is usually located on a server and can be accessed by a unique URL (a link to GitHub page for example).

**_Commit_** = To commit is to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. When you commit, you are basically taking a “snapshot” of your repository at that point in time, giving you a checkpoint to which you can re-evaluate or restore your project to any previous state. The terms ‘commit’ or ‘checkin’ can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing.

**_Revision / version_** = A revision or a version is any change in made in any form to a document(s).

**_Clone_** = Cloning means creating a repository containing the revisions from another repository. This is equivalent to pushing or pulling into an empty (newly initialized) repository. As a noun, two repositories can be said to be clones if they are kept synchronized, and contain the same revisions.

**_Pull / push_** = Copy revisions from one repository into another. Pull is initiated by the receiving repository, while push is initiated by the source. Fetch is sometimes used as a synonym for pull, or to mean a pull followed by an update.

**_Merge_** = A merge or integration is an operation in which two sets of changes are applied to a file or set of files.

A decision tree ‘asks a question’ and then classifies based on the answer. Question can be is or is not, smaller, greater, in-between, that kind of thing, applicable to quantitative and qualitative data, as can the classifications be numeric or categorical. Outcome classifications can be repeated. Top of the tree is the **Root-node**, followed by internal nodes and finally leaf nodes or leaves. The root (and the following nodes) is usually determined by the predictor variable with the lowest **impurity**. Impurity values of numerical data can also identify thresholds for decision making/classification thresholds within the tree.

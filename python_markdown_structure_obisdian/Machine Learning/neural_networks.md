One of the most popular algorithms in ML.

Popular algorithms in ML for image analysis. Great for pattern detection. Includes ‘hidden’ layers in the model. In a continuous image with many different objects CNNs are your friend. The stack of layers used to transform the input describes the ‘**architecture’** of the network.

FCN:
A fully connected layer means that all neurons of one layer connect to all neurons of the next/prior neuron layer

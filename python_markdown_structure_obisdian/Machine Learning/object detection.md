[[image classification]]
___

* Object detection: Locating presence and identifying classes of single or multiple objects in an image. Output, one or more bounding boxes/polygons (?) and their class label.

* Performance: Precision and sensitivity (recall) across the best matching bounding boxes of the known objects.

| Some terminology:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Precision =   “What % of all positive predictions was correct”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Precision** is a measure of saying that the predictions I made (, e.g. for a coral colony not belonging (0) – **belonging (1)** to a certain coral family) was made correctly in X% of all my ass positive (1) classified predictions.<br><br>(So I divide the from the mode correctly identified class, congruent with the ground truth, by the correctly identified and the areas that were falsely identified as belonging to the class.)                  |
| Recall =      “What proportion of true positives was identified”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Recall or sensitivity is a measure that describes the percentage, of e.g. a certain coral family (and thereof the surface area of image pixels probably), that was correctly classified as belonging to that family class.<br><br>(So I divide the from the model correctly identified class, congruent with the ground truth, by the correctly identified and correct areas that were falsely identified as not belonging to that class.)                      |
| **Note** that: By using a binary classifier so classifying between not belonging to – belonging to that class, Precision and Sensitivity are related. In that if we increase the precision of a model, by achieving less false positive (FPs) predictions, e.g. by choosing a higher threshold for what becomes a positive prediction, we at the same reduce the sensitivity of the model as we increase the number of positives identified as negatives (FNs). |

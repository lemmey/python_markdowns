A part of ML. Also **Deep neural network** learning, in contrast to shallow learning, learns model parameters not directly from the training data features, but rather from the preceding layers of its architecture. The architecture of Deep Neural Networks includes a input node(s), more than one hidden layer and an output node(s).

A deep learning algorithm of a NN can be described through 2 major processes:

* Forward Propagation: The p of info from the input layer to the output layer. Input layer neurons are connected to the next neuron layer by channels

* Back Propagation: Information here is past the other way round. However the input data for Back Propagation
